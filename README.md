# KPI_SCHOOL_bot

## Bot issues
- ### mysql-connector-python lib isn't async
this bot isn't complete asynchronous, because I didn't find async MySQL lib :D
- ### you can't write descriptions with spaces
because it will break the order of arguments
- ### you need user id to send file
constantly searching for user ID can be a bit annoying

<i>**I promise to fix it soon :)**</i>
